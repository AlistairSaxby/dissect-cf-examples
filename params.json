{"name":"DISSECT-CF-examples","tagline":"Example sources to demonstrate the capabilities of DISSEC-CF","body":"### Welcome to DISSECT-CF examples.\r\nThese pages are intended to help you get into the depths of the simulations possible with DISSECT-CF. The sources provided here are aimed at showing more complete and complex use cases of the simulator. Despite the complex use cases, the examples project was designed with simplicity in mind to allow a gentle but detailed introduction to the concepts of the simulator.\r\n\r\nWhen using the simulator for scientific research please cite the following paper: \r\n- [Gabor Kecskemeti: DISSECT-CF: A simulator to foster energy-aware scheduling in infrastructure clouds. In Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory. 2015.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277297657_DISSECT-CF_a_simulator_to_foster_energy-aware_scheduling_in_infrastructure_clouds) DOI: [10.1016/j.simpat.2015.05.009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.simpat.2015.05.009)\r\n\r\n### The API documentation\r\n\r\nThe [javadoc API](javadoc/1.0) of this project shows the intentions of each command line utility, as well as the intended behavior of the complex use cases for the simulator. Although the javadocs are already useful for introductory material, it is recommended to read the in line comments in the sources of this project as well to get a better grasp of the simulator's usage.\r\n\r\nFor past project releases an archive for the API can be found here.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nApart from the documentation listed here, one can find plenty of useful information about the way the simulator is intended to work at the simulator's homepage. In case you still have some questions, please share them with the simulator's user and developer community at our [Q&A forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dissect-cf-discuss) - a registration is needed to send your questions in.","google":"UA-64484627-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
